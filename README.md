# Firebase-Cloud-Messaging-App

This app demonstrates the integration of Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send push notifications to users. FCM allows developers to send notifications and messages to users across platforms such as iOS, Android, and web applications. This app includes the setup for receiving, handling, and displaying notifications in response to push messages sent from the Firebase console or a custom backend.

Features:
- Real-time Push Notifications: Receive push notifications in the background and foreground.
- Cross-platform: Compatible with both Android and Web platforms.
- Firebase Integration: Leverages Firebase's scalable messaging infrastructure.
- Easy-to-use Setup: Ready-to-deploy code for integrating FCM into any app.

Requirements:
- Firebase project with FCM enabled.
- Google Cloud Platform account (for sending notifications via the backend, if necessary).

How to Use:
1. Set up a Firebase project and enable Cloud Messaging.
2. Add your Firebase configuration to the app.
3. Test by sending push notifications from the Firebase console or custom backend.
